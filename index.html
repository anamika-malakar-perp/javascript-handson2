    <p>3.You are given an integer A, denoting the age of a person, and your task is to determine whether he/she is eligible to vote or not.</p>
    <p>4.PrepBuddy wants you to get familiar with various Relational operators. He provides you with two integer values X and Y and asks you to find the relation between them.
    The relationships between integers X and Y are as follows:
    If X < Y, it means that X is smaller than Y.
    If X > Y, it means that X is greater than Y.
    If X = Y, it means that X is equal to Y.

    <p>5.Your school has the following grading system based upon the marks(M) obtained by a student:
        If M ≤ 10, the grade will be E.
        If 11≥ M ≤ 20, the grade will be D.
        If 21≥ M ≤ 30, the grade will be C.
        If 31≥ M ≤ 40, the grade will be B.
        If 41≥ M ≤ 50, the grade will be A.
        Your friend will enter his marks out of 50, and your task is to print his grades using a switch statement.
    </p>
